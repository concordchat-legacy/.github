# What is Concord?
Concord is a chatting platform built for privacy, speed and scale.

# Why Concord
Unlike something like Discord or Guilded we are open-source,
meaning you can fork the project and host it yourself!

# Contact
You can contact us via our email, our discussion repo [Concord](https://github.com/concordchat/concord), or our Official [Discord](https://discord.gg/JgpM79pH9z)

# NitroDB Implementation
